The Andi AI Search API has a single endpoint that handles all search operations.

## Base URL

```text
https://search-api.andisearch.com
```

## Authentication

Pass your API key in the `x-api-key` header with every request:

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=test" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Get an API key from the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com).

## Endpoint

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/search` | Search the web |

The endpoint supports two search modes (`fast` and `deep`), multiple output formats, and filtering by domain, date, content type, and more.

Browse the **Endpoints** section in the sidebar to try the search endpoint in the interactive playground.
