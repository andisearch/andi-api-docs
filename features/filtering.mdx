title: Filtering
description: Filter search results by domain, date, and content type.
---

The API supports filtering through both query parameters and in-query operators. This page covers the parameter-based approach — see [query operators](/features/query-operators) for inline syntax.

## Domain filtering

Restrict results to specific domains or exclude unwanted ones.

### Include domains

Return results only from the specified domains:

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=python+tutorials&includeDomains=docs.python.org,realpython.com" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Exclude domains

Remove specific domains from results:

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=python+tutorials&excludeDomains=w3schools.com,pinterest.com" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Wildcards

Match all subdomains with `*`:

```bash
# Include all subdomains of example.com
?includeDomains=*.example.com

# Exclude all subdomains of example.com
?excludeDomains=*.example.com
```

## Date filtering

Filter results by publication date using relative ranges or absolute dates.

### Relative date ranges

Use `dateRange` for common time windows:

```bash
# Results from the past week
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=tech+news&dateRange=week" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Available values: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`.

### Absolute date ranges

Use `dateFrom` and `dateTo` for specific date boundaries:

```bash
# Results from Q1 2025
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=quarterly+earnings&dateFrom=2025-01-01&dateTo=2025-03-31" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You can use one or both:
- `dateFrom` alone — results from that date onward
- `dateTo` alone — results up to that date
- Both — results within the range

## Content filtering

Filter by file type or where terms appear on the page.

### File type

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=annual+report&filetype=pdf" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Title, URL, and body text

```bash
# Term must appear in the page title
?intitle=tutorial

# Term must appear in the URL
?inurl=api

# Term must appear in the body text
?intext=benchmarks
```

## Combined filtering

Filters stack — combine them to narrow results precisely:

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=machine+learning&includeDomains=arxiv.org,github.com&dateRange=month&filetype=pdf&limit=20" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This searches for machine learning PDFs on arxiv.org and github.com from the past month.
