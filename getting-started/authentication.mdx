description: How to authenticate with the Andi Search API using API keys.
---

Every request to the Andi Search API must include an API key in the `x-api-key` header.

<Snippet file="auth-header.mdx" />

## Getting an API key

1. Sign in to the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com)
2. Go to **API Keys**
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Copy the key — it's only shown once

## Managing keys

The API Console lets you:

- **Create** multiple keys for different applications or environments
- **Rename** keys to identify their purpose
- **Enable/disable** keys without deleting them
- **Revoke** keys that are no longer needed

Each key tracks its own usage. You can monitor request counts and credit consumption per key in the console.

## Security practices

<Warning>
Treat API keys like passwords. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

- Store keys in environment variables or a secrets manager
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Rotate keys periodically
- Revoke keys immediately if compromised
- Restrict key access to team members who need it

```bash
# Store your key in an environment variable
export ANDI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Reference it in requests
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=test" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANDI_API_KEY"
```
