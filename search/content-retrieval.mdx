description: Full HTML content retrieval from search results — coming soon.
---

<Info>
Content retrieval is coming soon. This page will be updated when the feature is available.
</Info>

Content retrieval will allow you to fetch the full HTML content of pages returned in search results. This is useful for:

- Extracting full article text for RAG pipelines
- Building datasets from web sources
- Deep content analysis beyond snippets

## Available now

While content retrieval is in development, you can use the `extracts` parameter to get text extracts from result pages (returned as an array on each result, when available):

```bash
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=your+query&extracts=true" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

See [fast search](/search/fast-search) and [deep search](/search/deep-search) for the search modes available today.
