Deep search provides enhanced analysis with spell correction, broader source coverage, and more detailed results. Responses take approximately 2–3 seconds.

Enable deep search by setting `depth=deep`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=quantm+computing+applications&depth=deep" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search",
    params={"q": "quantm computing applications", "depth": "deep"},
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=quantm+computing+applications&depth=deep",
  { headers: { "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" } }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The example query intentionally misspells "quantum" — deep search corrects it automatically.
</Note>

## What deep search adds

- **Spell correction** — fixes typos and misspellings in the query
- **Extended source coverage** — searches a broader set of sources
- **Enhanced analysis** — applies deeper relevance scoring to results

## When to use deep search

- Research queries where completeness matters
- Queries from user input that may contain typos
- Applications that prioritize result quality over speed
- Complex or multi-faceted topics

## Example response

```json
{
  "results_type": "search",
  "answer": "",
  "type": "search",
  "title": "quantum computing applications",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Quantum Computing: Current Applications and Future Potential",
      "link": "https://example.com/quantum-applications",
      "desc": "Quantum computing is being applied in cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems...",
      "source": "example.com",
      "type": "website"
    }
  ],
  "correctedQuery": "quantum computing applications",
  "metrics": {
    "query": "quantum computing applications",
    "intent": "FallbackSearchIntent",
    "duration": 2340,
    "results_returned": 10,
    "total_results_found": 85
  }
}
```

Note that the `correctedQuery` field shows the corrected spelling.
