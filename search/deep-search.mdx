description: Enhanced search mode with spell correction, more sources, and deeper analysis in ~2–3 seconds.

Deep search provides enhanced analysis with spell correction, broader source coverage, and more detailed results. Responses take approximately 2–3 seconds.

Enable deep search by setting `depth=deep`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=quantm+computing+applications&depth=deep" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search",
    params={"q": "quantm computing applications", "depth": "deep"},
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=quantm+computing+applications&depth=deep",
  { headers: { "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" } }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The example query intentionally misspells "quantum" — deep search corrects it automatically.
</Note>

## What deep search adds

- **Spell correction** — fixes typos and misspellings in the query
- **Extended source coverage** — searches a broader set of sources
- **Enhanced analysis** — applies deeper relevance scoring to results

## When to use deep search

- Research queries where completeness matters
- Queries from user input that may contain typos
- Applications that prioritize result quality over speed
- Complex or multi-faceted topics

## Example response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Quantum Computing: Current Applications and Future Potential",
      "url": "https://example.com/quantum-applications",
      "snippet": "Quantum computing is being applied in cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems...",
      "type": "website",
      "domain": "example.com"
    }
  ],
  "intent": "web",
  "query": "quantum computing applications"
}
```

Note that the `query` field reflects the corrected spelling.

## Pricing

Deep search costs **$25 per 1,000 queries**. Monitor your usage in the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com).
