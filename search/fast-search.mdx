description: Default search mode optimized for speed, returning results in ~1 second.
---

Fast search is the default mode. It returns results in approximately 1 second, making it suitable for real-time applications and high-volume workloads.

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=latest+AI+news" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search",
    params={"q": "latest AI news"},
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search?q=latest+AI+news",
  { headers: { "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" } }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

Fast search is the default — no `depth` parameter is needed. Setting `depth=fast` explicitly has the same effect.

## When to use fast search

- Real-time search in user-facing applications
- High-volume automated queries
- AI agents that need quick answers
- Applications where latency matters more than exhaustive coverage

## Example response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Latest AI News and Developments",
      "url": "https://example.com/ai-news",
      "snippet": "A roundup of the latest developments in artificial intelligence...",
      "type": "website",
      "domain": "example.com"
    }
  ],
  "intent": "news",
  "query": "latest AI news"
}
```

## Fast search vs. deep search

| | Fast search | Deep search |
|---|---|---|
| Response time | ~1 second | ~2–3 seconds |
| Spell correction | No | Yes |
| Source coverage | Standard | Extended |
| Analysis depth | Standard | Enhanced |
| Pricing | $7 per 1,000 queries | $25 per 1,000 queries |

<Tip>
Start with fast search. Switch to deep search only when you need spell correction, broader coverage, or enhanced analysis.

## Pricing

Fast search costs **$7 per 1,000 queries**. Monitor your usage in the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com).
