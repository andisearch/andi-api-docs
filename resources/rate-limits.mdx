title: Rate limits
description: Rate limit configuration and handling for the Andi Search API.
---

Rate limits control how many requests an API key can make within a time window. They protect the service and ensure fair usage across all consumers.

## Default limits

Rate limits are configured per API key through the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com). Limits use a per-second sliding window. The default limit is set when you create a key and can be adjusted based on your needs.

<Info>
Contact [support](mailto:hello+api@andiai.com) if you need higher rate limits than what's available in the console.

## Rate limit headers

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429` status code with a `Retry-After` header:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying (set to `1` on `429` responses) |

## Handling 429 responses

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429` status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit of N requests per second exceeded"
}
```

Use the `Retry-After` header to determine when to retry:

```python
import time
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://search-api.andisearch.com/api/v1/search",
    params={"q": "test"},
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

if response.status_code == 429:
    retry_after = int(response.headers.get("Retry-After", 1))
    time.sleep(retry_after)
    # Retry the request
```

## Monitoring usage

Track your request volume and credit consumption in the [API Console](https://console.andiai.com). Per-key usage data helps you identify which applications or environments are consuming the most requests.
